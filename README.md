Project Title:AI-Powered Legal Contract Risk Analyzer
Introduction
AI-Powered Legal Contract Risk Analyzer is a data analytics and NLP-based web application designed to analyze legal contracts and identify potential risk clauses.
The system extracts important clauses from uploaded contracts and classifies them into risk categories such as High, Medium, or Low.
It also assigns a risk score to each clause to support data-driven decision-making.
The application is built using Python, Streamlit, and Natural Language Processing techniques.
This project helps legal teams and organizations reduce manual contract review effort and improve risk management efficiency.
My Role in this Project
I worked as the Data Analytics and NLP Developer, handling contract analysis, risk scoring, UI development, and deployment.
Project Impact on My Growth
This project improved my skills in text analytics, NLP, and end-to-end application development using Python and Streamlit.
How to Use:
1. Open the deployed app link
2. Upload a legal contract (.txt / .pdf / .docx)
3. View clause-wise risk analysis instantly
Conclusion:
The AI-Powered Legal Contract Risk Analyzer provides an automated approach to identify risky clauses and support informed decision-making.
By reducing manual contract review effort, the system improves efficiency and accuracy.
This project highlights the practical use of analytics, Python, and Streamlit in building an end-to-end, deployable solution.
